## 📌 About Me

I am an IT professional with a strong foundation in **web technologies, QA testing, server infrastructure, and Python**.

My career began in a large-scale hardware environment, where I worked as a Laboratory Technician and later as a Junior Test Engineer for one of the biggest global semiconductor manufacturers.  
There, I assembled, maintained, and tested enterprise-class server components, including DIMM modules, and worked daily with automated Python-based test frameworks, JIRA, and Agile/Scrum workflows.

Currently, I work as a **Senior Support Agent**, handling technical cases related to payments, shipping, bugs, and system issues — while staying close to documentation, debugging, and error analysis.

After hours, I’m sharpening my skills in:  
- **Python** (QA + AI development)  
- **Prompt Engineering & LLMs**  
- **UI/UX & front-end development**  
- **Automation testing (Playwright, Cypress)**  

Also after hours I design and build websites, create prototypes in Figma, and explore how AI can streamline testing workflows and enhance digital experiences.
